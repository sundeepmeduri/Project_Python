Tuple:
-------
 a tuple is immutable object and once created we can modify ,inser or delete anything in the tuple. tuple is created using the round brackets.
 tuple1 = (1,2,3,4)
 if we need modifications all we need to is convert the tuple into list, make changes and assign back to the tuple
 
 
 sets:
 --------
 a set is created using {}. when we create set the elemensts in the set are always unordered. A set will not allow duplicates.
 set1 = {1,2,3,4}
 print(set1) # every time you execute this 
 print(1 in set1) # Set is best used to determine the element is present or not.
 
 set1 = {1,2,3,4}
 set2 = {3,4,5}
print(set.union(set2))
print(set.intersection(set2))
print(set.difference(set2))
# the above union, intersecion and union gives better performance with set than list and tuple.
